The rocket uses a total of 9954.4 kg fuel to boost its speed 1000 m/s


    FROM E: 
The rocket's position is at x = 7035.95 km, y = 150.36 km

When the rocket reaches it's escape velocity of 10475 m/s, it's
velocity has a horisontal component of 10469.8 m/s and a vertical
component of 329.344 m/s
The simulated rocket launch took 421 seconds, which is
approximately 7 minutes
When the rocket reached it's escape velocity, it's total mass was
down to 1267.07 kg, which means it lost a total of 39832.9 kg fuel

When the rocket reached it's escape velocity, it's total mass was
down to 2453.99 kg, which means it lost a total of 43646 kg fuel

    LAUNCH RESULTS:
Rocket was moved up by 4.50388e-06 m to stand on planet surface.
New launch parameters set.
Launch completed, reached escape velocity in 391.71 s.
Your spacecraft position deviates too much from the correct position.

    VERIFICATION RESULTS:
The deviation is approximately 2.67408e-06 AU.
Make sure you have included the rotation and orbital velocity of your home planet.
Note that units are AU and relative the the reference system of the star.

    WITH SHORTCUT:
Your spacecraft position was satisfyingly calculated. Well done!
